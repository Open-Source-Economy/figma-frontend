# Design System and Branding

This repository contains the **frontend code for Open Source Economy** that was generated by [Figma Make](https://www.figma.com/make/) (Figma AI).

## Overview

We use **Figma AI to generate the frontend code only**. This codebase represents the UI and UX components exported from Figma Make. After generation, we:

1. **Import the UI and UX** - Bring the generated components and designs into our frontend structure
2. **Clean the files** - Remove unnecessary code, fix formatting, and optimize the generated output
3. **Add logic and backend connections** - Integrate the UI components with our backend API and implement the necessary business logic

## Development Workflow

While we strive to configure Figma AI to generate the cleanest code possible, **it is often more efficient to refactor, delete, or modify the generated code** during the import process. This approach allows us to:

- Remove redundant or unused code
- Apply our coding standards and best practices
- Optimize component structure for maintainability
- Ensure proper integration with our existing frontend architecture

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
